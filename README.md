## About
This is a simple template for a Discord bot. The code is not optimized for sharding or multiple concurrent sessions and it is provided for **educational purposes** only.

## Installation
For Linux, run start.sh which uses the traditional initialization methods or start2.sh for the modern ones. Do not forget to make the scripts executable.
For Windows, create a new virtual environment for the project and run start.bat.
