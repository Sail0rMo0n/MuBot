## About
This is a simple template for a Discord bot. The code is not optimized for sharding or multiple concurrent sessions and it is provided for **educational purposes** only.

## Deployment
- Create a new bot on Discord dev portal
- Generate and add your Discord token in .env
- For Linux, run start.sh which uses the traditional initialization methods or start2.sh for the modern ones (do not forget to make the scripts executable)
- For Windows, create a new virtual environment for the project and run start.bat
